## *Mobile application for searching and sharing real-life locations from Japanese pop culture*

## React Native, React Navigation, and Nativebase

- Led frontend development effort for key features including photo upload, gallery navigation
- Implemented user authentication and account creation using MongoDB Realm cloud services
- Researched & integrated mobile feature libraries such as React Navigation, React Native Maps
- Leveraged frontend frameworks to efficiently rapid-prototype component layout, functionality

My role as frontend engineer familiarized me with the advantages and disadvantages of React Native and its *accompanying frameworks and libraries*.

In addition to gaining insight into state management in the context of a mobile application, making use of React's *useContext* API, specific libraries such as *react-native-maps* (location maps) and *MongoDB Realm* (user authentication) were also implemented.<br/>

        navigation.navigate('Location Results', {

          mediaId,
          description,
        })
      }>

```
