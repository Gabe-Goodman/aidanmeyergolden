## React Native, React Navigation, and Nativebase
My role as frontend engineer familiarized me with the advantages and disadvantages of React Native and its *accompanying frameworks and libraries*. Using Android Emulator, we prioritized development for launch via the Google Play Console.

In addition to gaining insight into state management in the context of a mobile application, making use of React's *useContext* API, specific libraries such as *react-google-maps* (location maps) and *MongoDB Realm* (user authentication) were also implemented.<br/>

## Navigation

      onPress={() =>
        navigation.navigate('Location Results', {
          name,
          mediaId,
          description,
        })
      }>

```
