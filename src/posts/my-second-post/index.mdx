### Smoke choked eyes

Smoke choked eyes  
back sore from pack  
Still I’d like to go further  
=  
Running up the mountain  
to see the rain  
leaving happy downward trails.  
=  
Refugee to the mind:  
tragedy not encountered.  
When heard, with hands over eyes,  
quickly evades, lest it overtake  
and leave roadside progress of happier times.  
To take refuge is to admit:  
O yes I am a fool -
haven’t you seen me?
The weather is weeping,  
silently, off and on,  
with a great pressure.  
At times believed:  
the great pouring selfsick.  
I ask if this time true,  
I cry with, to now again be soaked.  
It lambs, rather than wolf,  
bleats the heart,  
no option but forgive.
If the rainbow is not to come for another million days,  
or not again before my death,  
still I must not ask for it,  
and with a smile feign  
a lasting lack of import.
The sun again seems to shine through &#8212;  
without fail I believe it to be  
an end.
o you, life, guard that Am  
is without ends,  
that only in poetry will the world gain sense  
and the earth is no poet,  
is before poet  
and I am no poet  
\--- Am in the jaws of One.<br />=<br />
I don’t care to count breath  
all around I hear a sameness sameness snoring  
and sometimes white lilies emerge from a black pool  
it seems the heavens unravel<br />
I rub my eyes &#8212; a daydream<br />=<br />
Enough said  
the drunk’s foot<br />=<br />
When’s the last time  
a book changed you<br />=<br />
I sit here,  
watch green grass,  
am younger than birth.<br />\*<br />
My muscles clench.
I rush to unclench.  
Underslept day after a big drunk.<br />\*<br />
I slack.
I am full of fear, of the world killing me.  
If I wait long enough blood will rush back  
push off fear, silent muttering inner tongue,  
lick the inside of my skull clean.<br />
It’s hunger with a boot slipping down an incline.  
O yes it were poems which do  
cast blossom  
on the day of first frost.<br />=<br />
Morph and pervert old stories -  
write the godsong.  
Knock on the flaps of the tents of Israel,  
a salesman with the blood of the lamb.<br />
Horror! Horror! The death of nation  
when it leaves a single book  
for all of its lashes.<br />
Rosy-cheek dawn on the cover,  
young, full of sex, mist.<br />
Here we run to the fingers of firstlight,  
its warmth, and panting, tired,  
attribute the heat of sweat to Day.  
And to Night - the stories crop up again.<br />
and tremble in the vision of mushroom.  
Unroot your mycelium drowned feet  
to stand still, kiss death, breeze,<br />
It in the trees like some animal,  
the wanderer is followed only by ghosts  
all else not so interested in what looks like madman -  
but only the wandering can see the bald mountaintops,  
rusty veins, rivers, connecting night to day:<br />
Wait, to see the self drift off  
like the raincloud which stands in front of dawn  
and left are stories, weeds, perverse  
which throb with the life of things.<br />=<br />
That I may not harden  
I give myself to weakness.
